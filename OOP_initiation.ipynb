Using inheritance in our classes is useful because if an except block catches a particular exception class, it will also catch its child classes (because a child class is its parent class). That means that we can efficiently write except blocks which handle groups of related exceptions, just by arranging them in a logical hierarchy. Our exception classes should inherit from Python’s built-in exception classes. They often won’t need to contain any additional attributes or methods.\n",
